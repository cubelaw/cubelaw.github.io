## Judging Criteria & Submission Requirements

The final product for the CUBE Innovators Competition will be a five-page proposal or business plan and an accompanying five-minute pitch or presentation, that (a) identifies a problem in legal practice, legal administration, or lawmaking, and (b) proposes an innovative technological solution or approach that effectively and feasibly addresses the problem presented. 

Please note that, unlike prior years, the 5th Annual CUBE Innovators competition will be focused on developing technological solutions. Non-technological ventures will not be eligible for participation. 

The final pitch will take place before a panel of judges, who will receive the proposals in advance of the final competition.  The proposals and pitch together will be considered in selecting a winner.

Submissions and presentations will be judged on five criteria:

1. How clearly and concisely the proposal states a problem and a proposed solution;
2. How feasibly and effectively the proposal addresses the stated problem;
3. How well the problem and proposal presented are supported by analysis and research;
4. How innovative the proposal is, as compared to existing or analogous solutions;
5. How well the presentation demonstrates competence and capability to implement the proposal, including but not limited to how well the seed money, if won, would further the venture’s mission. 

Applications will be delivered and revised in accordance with the Competition schedule.  Each individual or team must meet each deadline (see important dates below) to be eligible for the Competition.

Participants in the CUBE Innovators Competition may work as individuals or in teams of no more than three (3) people. Contestants from last year’s Innovators Competition who did not win are eligible to apply. For each team, one student on the team will be deemed the “Team Leader” and will be responsible for receiving Competition updates and communicating them to the team.  Your team may include students and non-students, but the final pitch must be delivered by a current Brooklyn Law School student.

All work must be original to the team submitting the proposal.  The CUBE Faculty will be solely responsible for accepting and evaluating proposals and for determining which proposals will be advanced at any stage of the Competition.
